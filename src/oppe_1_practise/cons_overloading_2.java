//Write a program to implement constructor overloading. Define a class Box that contains three parameters: width, height, and depth
//(you may use int or double, based on your preference). Implement multiple constructors similar to the previous example to initialize
//these parameters in different ways.
//
//1. If the constructor is called with one argument, set the other two parameters to default values.
//2. Similarly, if the constructor is called with two arguments, assign a default value to the remaining parameter.
//
//Additionally, define a method (e.g., print) to display the initialized values.
//ethat each constructor appropriately initializes the Box object based on the number of arguments provided.
